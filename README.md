# line_analysis

This repository contains the code used for the line-by-line analysis detailed in Jiang et al. 2022 _Revisiting Îµ Eridani with NEID: Identifying New 
Activity-Sensitive Lines in a Young K Dwarf Star_ (in prep). This code has two parts: 'make_cube' from a list of lines and a list of NEID
observations, and 'calculate_correlations' from that cube. The specific cube used in the paper can be found [here](https://github.com/sarahxj/eps_eri_cube).

This code is _not_ intended to be a released package for public use but rather a reference for the method used in our analysis.
